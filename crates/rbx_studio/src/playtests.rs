//! Recorded playtests: what a Play session's players did, kept in the
//! editor's own data folder (never in the place) and replayed over the
//! edit-mode 3D view.
//!
//! - `recorder`: turns a Play session's `Uplink`s into a [`Recording`].
//! - `format`: the compact binary file a recording is saved as.
//! - `store`: one folder per place; list, save, rename, delete.
//! - `heat`: heat maps across recordings — time spent, deaths, stuck spots.
//! - `replay`: a recording at a moment, as lines and dots for the viewport.
